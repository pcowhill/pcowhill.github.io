    <!-- Describe how to run the game -->
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome!
    </p>
    <p>
      Think you know lots of U.S. cities?  Test your knowledge below to find
      out how much of the U.S. map you are able to fill in by naming cities!
    </p>
    <p>
      For each city you name, all nearby cities within a particular radius
      are also revealed to you without having to name them directly.  Scores
      are shown below the map that describe the number of cities that have been
      named, what proportion of U.S. cities have been revealed, and some other
      fun goals to aim for.  When you loaded the page, the map should have
      automatically been set to an appropriate size.  However, if you would
      prefer to change the size of the map, use the buttons above the map.  This
      quiz includes the 48 contiguous states and D.C. totally to 49 "states."
    </p>
    <p>
      Are you able to name 1000 citites?  Cover each state at least once?  Or do
      you think you can reveal all of the citites within the U.S.?  The only
      way to proove yourself and find out is to scroll down and start naming
      cities.  Have fun!
    </p>
