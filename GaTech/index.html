              The Fall of 2021 marked the beginning of my pursuit toward personal advancement as I enrolled in Georgia Tech's Professional Education program to earn my Master's in Electrical and Computer Engineering.  This degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) seamlessly integrates coursework from both disciplines, enabling me to explore a diverse range of topics.  By taking a total of 10 courses across these fields, I had the flexibility to address gaps in my knowledge from my undergraduate majors of Physics and Mathematics while also gaining experience in areas I sought to grow professionally.  The Professional Education program provided the flexibility and support necessary to maintain my commitment to academic excellence at Georgia Tech while seamlessly managing the responsibilities of my full-time role as a software engineer.  As a testament to my dedication and the quality of this program, I was able to graduate with a 4.0 GPA while during this time becoming an integrated product team lead for three actively deployed technologies, managing tasking for a team of nine engineers and scientists, and achieving recognition as an inventor for two awarded U.S. patents.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my undergraduate education at the University of Florida, between my Physics labs and Mathematics classes, I was able to take a few courses that covered computer engineering and software development such as Intro to C, Numerical Analysis, and Physics Modeling in Python.  I was also able to use MATLAB intensively within my undergraduate research role for 2 years and Mathematica while guest lecturing for a 4000-level Mechanics 2 course.  While these ultimately became the skills that got me my first job in software engineering, I felt as though there was still much more that I could learn to become even more proficient.  
            </p>
            <p>
              My education at Georgia Tech profoundly shaped my understanding of both Electrical and Computer Engineering, equipping me with advanced skills that significantly elevated my career.  The program's flexible cource selection allowed me to strategically tailor my studies to complement the cutting-edge technologies I actively researched and developed at work.  Through this journey, I deepened my expertise in computer architecture and software development, mastered advanced mathematical concepts such as Fourier analysis, signal processing, and partial differential equations, and ventured into new domains like computer network security and adaptive filtering.

            <p>
              This project was inspired by the discovery of Why No HTTPS, a website that catalogs popular platforms delivering content over unencrypted connections. A substantial number of these websites are hosted in China, raising questions about the state of secure web protocols in the region.
            </p>
            <p>
              The goal of this research was to examine the adoption and implementation of HTTPS and SSL certificates in online services based in China. By analyzing trends in secure web traffic, this project explored the broader implications of utilizing—or neglecting—the TLS protocol, affecting both servers and clients interacting with these services.

            <p>
              This group project provided a unique opportunity to explore the intersection of simulation and game theory through the popular board game Ticket to Ride. In this game, players compete to build the most extensive train network across the United States, requiring strategic decision-making to win. However, with multiple strategies available, one key question arises: which approach is the most effective?
            </p>
            <p>
              Our research aimed to develop an accurate model of Ticket to Ride, incorporating all essential gameplay elements—train pieces, cards, routes, turns, and scoring. To test different strategies, we programmed artificial agents with distinct decision-making processes and ran hundreds of simulations where they competed against one another. By analyzing performance metrics, we identified the most successful, reliable, and complementary strategies, offering valuable insights into optimal gameplay.

            <p>
              This project explores cutting-edge techniques in image change detection, leveraging partial differential equations to refine computer vision capabilities. By analyzing two images captured at different times, the algorithm intelligently filters out incidental variations while emphasizing significant transformations within the scene. With an advanced weighting system, it enhances the later image to reveal persistent patterns, making this approach a powerful tool for applications in surveillance, medical imaging, and environmental monitoring.
            </p>
            <p>
              The research began with establishing the necessary mathematical foundations, formulating a multivariate, second-order Euler-Lagrange equation, and computing the relevant partial derivatives for the analyzed energy functional. These mathematical principles were then implemented in MATLAB, allowing rigorous testing of the algorithm on example imagery.
